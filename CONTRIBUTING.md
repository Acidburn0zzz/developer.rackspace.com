# Contributing to this repository

We welcome contributions to this repository. To make a contribution, please send a pull request (PR) to the "dev" branch of this repository. This is the default behavior so you shouldn't have to do anything special when sending in your PR.

Sometimes you might want to get a PR started but still keep working on it. This way, others will be able to review your work and give you guidance, before it's ready to be merged into the "dev" branch. To indicate this, add the "wip" label to your PR.

## Contribution workflow

Once you send in your contribution PR, the following steps will take place:

1. The PR will be reviewed by members of our team. Our team members may comment on your PR to discuss specific changes. Eventually, you may re-send an updated PR and it will be merged by a member of our team into the "dev" branch of this reposistory.

2. Your contribution will be pushed to our staging web site. We will do a quick visual review of these changes to make sure they look good.

3. Assuming everything looks good, we will merge these changes into the "master" branch of this repository.

4. Your contribution will be pushed to our production web site.
