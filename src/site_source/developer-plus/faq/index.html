      <h3><a name="what_is" id="what_is"></a>What is the developer+™ program?</h3>

      <p>developer+ is a program to introduce developers to Rackspace and Fanatical Support® and help them grow with
        Rackspace and adopt the Managed Cloud.</p>

      <p>The Service Level Rate and Service Level minimums are removed from customers participating in the program.
        They are provided with an infrastructure credit of $50 a month for 12 months that covers a base set of
        services. As with all Rackspace customers, participants in developer+ are provided the following services at
        no charge: Cloud DNS, Cloud Orchestration, Cloud Monitoring, Mailgun™ (first 50,000 emails free), and Cloud
        Networking. Some support options in the customer portal have been removed for developer+ customers, such as
        one-to-one chat, support tickets, and the phone number. Tickets have been replaced with Billing Inquiries.</p>

      <p>As new products and services come online, they may be added to and highlighted in this program.</p>

      <p>Additionally, developer+ includes several direct feedback mechanisms as part of the terms and conditions of
        signup that allow our teams to get direct, honest feedback from customers. This feedback will enable us to
        examine our offerings, documentation, user experience, and more. This opens channels of communication and
        direct feedback we have not, as a company had previously for this market.</p>

      <h3><a name="difference" id="difference"></a>What is the difference between developer+™ and the Startup Program?</h3>

      <p>developer+ offers a way for developers who are comfortable writing and deploying their code and require
        minimal assistance to use the Rackspace Cloud. </p>

      <p>The Rackspace Startup Program offers discounted infrastructure as a service and leverages Rackspace’s
        knowledge and experience in the business and technology communities to offer developing companies advice on
        how to best architect their product. The Startup Program also connects entrepreneurs to tools like
        ObjectRocket™ and Mailgun™, and gives them access to guidance on their startup through our extensive network
        of startup and technology business professionals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

      <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

      <h3><a name="identified" id="identified"></a>How is developer+ identified in the different Service Levels?</h3>

      <p>Customers in the developer+™ program are a part of the Managed Infrastructure service level, but have limited
        access to support Rackers and have a customized self-service view.</p>

      <p>Additionally, we offer developer-to-developer online support, which is delivered to developers in a way they
        are used to and expect. Developer-to-developer differs from online support only in scope and location--it is
        still the exceptional customer experience delivered by Fanatical Support that customers expect from
        Rackspace.</p>

      <p>The following features are part of developer+:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An enriched developer portal, developer guides and a continually improved developer experience based on
          direct feedback
        </li>
        <li>Rackspace Developer-to-Developer and troubleshooting support from our experts for your code leveraging our
          interfaces (APIs and SDKs)
        </li>
        <li>IRC (join us in #rackspace on irc.freenode.net)</li>
        <li>StackOverflow Community Forums, email, Hacker News, and other online communities<br><strong>Note:</strong>
          Tickets filed are limited to billing only
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3><a name="add_service" id="add_service"></a>What if developers want to add another server? Test a website or
        database?</h3>

      <p>developer+ customers can consume cloud at a "pay for what you consume" price for all services in any region
        at our adjusted infrastructure prices. They can consume ObjectRocket™, OnMetal™--everything currently
        available to our other customers.</p>

      <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

      <h3><a name="upgrade" id="upgrade"></a>Can developers upgrade to another service level?</h3>

      <p>At any time, participants in the program may log into the Control Panel and upgrade to our Managed Cloud
        service levels. Customers may not, however, switch to developer+.</p>

      <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

      <h3><a name="billing" id="billing"></a>How are developer+ customers billed?</h3>

      <p>Customers in developer+ pay only for infrastructure they consume over $50 per month. </p>

      <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

      <h3><a name="slas" id="slas"></a>Are developer+ customers eligiable for the SLA guarantees covered by Managed
        Infrastructure?</h3>

      <p>Yes, but their credit is reduced by 50 percent as noted in the Terms and Conditions.</p>
