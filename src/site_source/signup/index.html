      <p class="lead">developer+&trade; is a powerful, extendible and oh-did-we-mention no cost tier of cloud services that Rackspace makes available to serious technologist who want to go for a test drive. Unlike other offers out there, developer+&trade; gives you what you need to build a full, feature-rich stack, plus it puts you in direct contact with Rackspace's developers to help you get your idea off the ground.  It's the developer offering you'd expect from the Fanatical Support® company.</p>

      <h2>Ready for Development</h2>
      <p>
        developer+&trade; allows you to choose the services you need to get building today. We made sure that everything our own developers would want in an offer made it into developer+&trade;. It's powerful, simple and - best of all - useful.
      </p>

      <h2>Extensible from Day 1</h2>

      <p>
        In addition to the credit, you'll get access to the same great no-cost features we offer to all our customers. Things like monitoring, orchestration and backups are all included with developer+&trade;, just like they would be for any Rackspace customer. Let us know if you need help setting any of them up.
      </p>

      <h2>Fanatical Support&reg; for Devs</h2>

      <p>
        It wouldn't be Rackspace if we didn't have your back. The support we offer to developers often needs to be deeper than what other customers ask for. Because of that, we want to give you the time you need to get your questions answered. That's why we put you directly in touch with smart, development-focused technologists just like you. Rackers are ready to help you make your plans a reality.

      <h2>Stay in touch!</h2>

      <p>developer+&trade; is all about radical transparency, and that's a two-way street. We want to give you a product you'd actually want to use, and we want you to give us feedback about how you're using it.</p>

      <p>A big part of this offer isn't just about letting people test-drive our products or helping incubate great ideas, it's also about getting feedback on how Rackspace can get better at serving developers. See, we actually think that our best innovations come from listening to our customers. So we'll ask you to provide us with honest, candid feedback about what's awesome and what's not. We're serious about taking you seriously.</p>

      <h2>The Details</h2>

      <p>We give you a $50 credit each month that you can apply to whatever services you want. Want two 1GB CPUs or one 2GB? Your call. You want to hack together your own Load Balancer? Then don't pay us for one. We'll keep that arrangement with you for 12 months, at which point we'll welcome you fully to Rackspace, or help you move your stuff wherever you want to put it.</p>

      <p>If you need help or run into some issue, you get two support calls a month. Oh, and those go directly to a seasoned software developer at Rackspace just like you - someone who speaks your language and understands your issue. In the meantime, chat, email, whitepapers and forums will always be avaiable to you.</p>
 
      <p>Whenever you're ready, you can add additional services that exceed your credit limit, and we'll make you into a full-fledge Rackspace customer. We'll let you know before we start billing you. Don't worry - we won't pull a fast one.</p>
